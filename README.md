Hunter don't hurt 'em
==============

This web app is an audio sequencer I'm building for my 1 year-old daughter Hunter. It is optimized for multi-touch, high DPI (I refuse to write "Retina") devices with sloppy users. Don't worry. It will also work in your desktop browser... one boring 1/1 pixel ratio click at a time. It is built using only native functionality with no plugins or libraries because sometimes it's good to get your hands dirty. It takes advantage of the Web Audio Api for audio playback and Canvas for animations. 

Installation
---

To run this app, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. After that, you can start up the server by using the Connect plugin for Grunt.

    $ npm install
    $ grunt
    
Editing
---

If you'd like to edit any of the CoffeeScript or Sass files, Grunt can watch and compile your project for you. Just make sure to run the watch task.

    $ grunt watch
