Hunter don't hurt 'em
==============

This web app is an audio sequencer I'm building for my 1 year-old daughter Hunter. It is eventually intended for touch screen devices. It is built using only native functionality with no plugins or libraries. It takes advantage of the Web Audio Api and Canvas. 

Installation
---

To run this app, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. After that, you can start up the server by using the Connect plugin for Grunt.

    $ npm install
    $ grunt
    
Editing
---

If you'd like to edit any of the CoffeeScript or Sass files, Grunt can watch and compile your project for you. Just make sure to run the watch task.

    $ grunt watch
